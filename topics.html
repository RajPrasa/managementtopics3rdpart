        <h3 id="Product Management">Product Management</h3>
        <p> 
           Product management is an organizational function that guides every step of a product’s lifecycle — from development to positioning and pricing — by focusing on the product and its customers first and foremost. To build the best possible product, product managers advocate for customers within the organization and make sure the voice of the market is heard and heeded.
            Thanks to this focus on the customer, product teams routinely ship better-designed and higher-performing products. In tech, where entrenched products are quickly uprooted by newer and better solutions, there is more need than ever for an intimate understanding of customers and the ability to create tailored solutions for them. That’s where product management comes in.    

            <br>
            <br>
            Product management is typically divided into three parts: strategic product management, technical product management and Go-To-Market (product marketing), which is illustrated in the Open Product Management Workflow model. In addition to the three-part division, this model shows which tasks and steps must be performed by product management in the course of a product cycle in order to produce an innovative and profitable product.

<br>Strategic product management
Strategic product management encompasses all strategic aspects and tasks required to make an existing or future product successful. This includes, among other things, the information analysis, the development of a concept as well as coordination and optimization measures. In technical product management there is a similar approach.

Market analysis
The market analysis identifies existing market problems and trends.

For the determination of market problems, the conducting of interviews with customers as well as potentials (reports) has established itself, whereby existing problems are specifically asked for. Market trends are determined by the analysis of studies or with the help of market research. The results are checked by means of larger & regular surveys and that a market problem only refers to one persona ("stereotype for a group of people with concrete characteristics and concrete behaviour") in a certain scenario. If several products/markets are involved, they can be structured according to criteria such as market segments, product segments, functions, technologies or regions and later be illustrated, for example, in a product-market matrix. Market segmentation is of particular importance; strategic product management focuses on the target segments that have the greatest market potential and require the lowest costs.

Company analysis
Both for the future market message and for improved communication with customers, it is important to determine the attributes and added values that differentiate the company from the competition in the long term: "If you can do one thing best, you should do the one thing you can do". A competence analysis forms the basis for this. A competitive analysis and a SWOT analysis can provide further clarity. While the competitive analysis reveals gaps, among other things, the portfolio, price model, market message and communication analysis, the SWOT analysis determines the company's position in a specific market. In addition, the analysis can show what opportunities for further development and difficulties in implementation exist.

Technical product management
Technical product management includes all aspects and tasks necessary to design a functional physical new product.

Requirements rating
At the beginning the requirements from the strategic product management must be evaluated, which consist of the parts problem, persona and scenario. In practice, the information is written for it on so-called "Story Cards". With the help of an evaluation scheme with the criteria importance, number of reports and priority, the requirements can be weighted and prioritized. The importance is based on the different customer types in the following decreasing order: evaluating customer, potential customer, existing customer. The priority can be calculated by multiplying the importance and the number of reports. If required, the scheme can be supplemented with additional information such as costs, usability or time expenditure.[citation needed]

Product development
If the requirements are sufficiently prioritised, they can be bundled into work packages and put in order; for this purpose the respective priorities are summed up and an overall priority for a work package is calculated. Afterward, the time and costs required for the work packages must be estimated for product development. Then engineers devote themselves to the solution of the work packages, giving the entire team information about their current status in regular status meetings and modifying the schedule by possible delays. In order to check the functionality of a product solution or to reduce the risk of undesirable developments, the creation of a pre-prototype and a prototype is recommended.

        <h3 id="Operation Management">Operation Management</h3>
        <p> 
            Operations management (OM) is the administration of business practices to create the highest level of efficiency possible within an organization. It is concerned with converting materials and labor into goods and services as efficiently as possible to maximize the profit of an organization. Operations management teams attempt to balance costs with revenue to achieve the highest net operating profit possible.
            Operations management involves utilizing resources from staff, materials, equipment, and technology. Operations managers acquire, develop, and deliver goods to clients based on client needs and the abilities of the company.


            <br>
            <br>Operations management handles various strategic issues, including determining the size of manufacturing plants and project management methods and implementing the structure of information technology networks. Other operational issues include the management of inventory levels, including work-in-process levels and raw materials acquisition, quality control, materials handling, and maintenance policies.
            A critical function of operations management relates to the management of inventory through the supply chain. To be an effective operations management professional, one must be able to understand the processes that are essential to what a company does and get them to flow and work together seamlessly. The coordination involved in setting up business processes in an efficient way requires a solid understanding of logistics. 

An operations management professional understands local and global trends, customer demand, and the available resources for production. Operations management approaches the acquisition of materials and the use of labor in a timely, cost-effective manner to deliver customer expectations. Inventory levels are monitored to ensure excessive quantities are on hand. Operations management is responsible for finding vendors that supply the appropriate goods at reasonable prices and have the ability to deliver the product when needed.

Another large facet of operations management involves the delivery of goods to customers. This includes ensuring products are delivered within the agreed time commitment. Operations management also typically follows up with customers to ensure the products meet quality and functionality needs. Finally, operations management takes the feedback received and distributes the relevant information to each department to use in process improvement.

        <h3 id="Logistic & Supply Chain Management">Logistic & Supply Chain Management</h3>
        <p> 
            The supply chain management (SCM) profession has continued to change and evolve to fit the needs of the growing global supply chain.  With the supply chain covering a broad range of disciplines, the definition of what is a supply chain can be unclear. Often times SCM can be confused with the term logistics management. CSCMP and the board of directors, comprised of industry experts, created official definitions for the following terms.

CSCMP’s Definition of Supply Chain Management
Supply chain management encompasses the planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all logistics management activities. Importantly, it also includes coordination and collaboration with channel partners, which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers, and customers. In essence, supply chain management integrates supply and demand management within and across companies.

Supply Chain Management – Boundaries and Relationships
Supply chain management is an integrating function with primary responsibility for linking major business functions and business processes within and across companies into a cohesive and high-performing business model. It includes all of the logistics management activities noted above, as well as manufacturing operations, and it drives coordination of processes and activities with and across marketing, sales, product design, finance, and information technology.

           <br>
           <br>CSCMP’s Definition of Logistics Management
Logistics management is that part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverses flow and storage of goods, services and related information between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order to meet customers' requirements.

Logistics Management – Boundaries and Relationships
Logistics management activities typically include inbound and outbound transportation management, fleet management, warehousing, materials handling, order fulfillment, logistics network design, inventory management, supply/demand planning, and management of third party logistics services providers. To varying degrees, the logistics function also includes sourcing and procurement, production planning and scheduling, packaging and assembly, and customer service. It is involved in all levels of planning and execution--strategic, operational and tactical. Logistics management is an integrating function, which coordinates and optimizes all logistics activities, as well as integrates logistics activities with other functions including marketing, sales manufacturing, finance, and information technology.

        <h3 id="Power Management">Power Management</h3>
        <p> 
            The power management for microprocessors can be done over the whole processor, or in specific components, such as cache memory and main memory.

With dynamic voltage scaling and dynamic frequency scaling, the CPU core voltage, clock rate, or both, can be altered to decrease power consumption at the price of potentially lower performance. This is sometimes done in real time to optimize the power-performance tradeoff.

        <br>
            <br>Examples:

AMD Cool'n'Quiet
AMD PowerNow![1]
IBM EnergyScale[2]
Intel SpeedStep
Transmeta LongRun and LongRun2
VIA LongHaul (PowerSaver)
Additionally, processors can selectively power off internal circuitry (power gating). For example:

Newer Intel Core processors support ultra-fine power control over the functional units within the processors.
AMD CoolCore technology get more efficient performance by dynamically activating or turning off parts of the processor.[3]
Intel VRT technology split the chip into a 3.3V I/O section and a 2.9V core section. The lower core voltage reduces power consumption.

Heterogenous computing
ARM's big.LITTLE architecture can migrate processes between faster "big" cores and more power efficient "LITTLE" cores.
Much research has been done on the dynamic power reduction with the use of DVFS techniques. However, as technology continues to shrink, leakage power will become a dominant factor.[9] Power gating is a commonly used circuit technique to remove leakage by turning off the supply voltage of unused circuits. Power gating incurs energy overhead; therefore, unused circuits need to remain idle long enough to compensate this overheads. A novel micro-architectural technique[10] for run-time power-gating caches of GPUs saves leakage energy. Based on experiments on 16 different GPU workloads, the average energy savings achieved by the proposed technique is 54%. Shaders are the most power hungry component of a GPU, a predictive shader shut down power gating technique[11] achieves up to 46% leakage reduction on shader processors. The Predictive Shader Shutdown technique exploits workload variation across frames to eliminate leakage in shader clusters. Another technique called Deferred Geometry Pipeline seeks to minimize leakage in fixed-function geometry units by utilizing an imbalance between geometry and fragment computation across batches which removes up to 57% of the leakage in the fixed-function geometry units. A simple time-out power gating method can be applied to non-shader execution units which eliminates 83.3% of the leakage in non-shader execution units on average. All the three techniques stated above incur negligible performance degradation, less than 1%.

        <p> 
            Human resource management (HRM or HR) is the strategic approach to the effective and efficient management of people in a company or organization such that they help their business gain a competitive advantage. It is designed to maximize employee performance in service of an employer's strategic objectives.[1][need quotation to verify] Human resource management is primarily concerned with the management of people within organizations, focusing on policies and systems.[2] HR departments are responsible for overseeing employee-benefits design, employee recruitment, training and development, performance appraisal, and reward management, such as managing pay and employee-benefits systems.[3] HR also concerns itself with organizational change and industrial relations, or the balancing of organizational practices with requirements arising from collective bargaining and governmental laws.[4][need quotation to verify]

The overall purpose of human resources (HR) is to ensure that the organization is able to achieve success through people.[5] HR professionals manage the human capital of an organization and focus on implementing policies and processes. They can specialize in finding, recruiting, selecting, training, and developing employees, as well as maintaining employee relations or benefits. Training and development professionals ensure that employees are trained and have continuous development. This is done through training programs, performance evaluations, and reward programs. Employee relations deals with the concerns of employees when policies are broken, such as cases involving harassment or discrimination. Managing employee benefits includes developing compensation structures, parental leave programs, discounts, and other benefits for employees. On the other side of the field are HR generalists or business partners. These HR professionals could work in all areas or be labour relations representatives working with unionized employees.

HR is a product of the human relations movement of the early 20th Century, when researchers began documenting ways of creating business value through the strategic management of the workforce.[6] It was initially dominated by transactional work, such as payroll and benefits administration, but due to globalization, company consolidation, technological advances, and further research, HR as of 2015 focuses on strategic initiatives like mergers and acquisitions, talent management, succession planning, industrial and labor relations, and diversity and inclusion. In the current global work environment, most companies focus on lowering employee turnover and on retaining the talent and knowledge held by their workforce.[citation needed] New hiring not only entails a high cost but also increases the risk of a new employee not being able to adequately replace the position of the previous employee. HR departments strive to offer benefits that will appeal to workers, thus reducing the risk of losing employee commitment and psychological ownership.
